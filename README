    actions

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        package MyApp::Controller::Foo;
        use Moose;
        use namespace::autoclean;

        BEGIN { extends 'Catalyst::Controller::ActionRole' }

        __PACKAGE__->config(
            action_roles => [qw( ExpiresHeader )],
        );

        sub expire_in_one_day : Local Expires('+1d') { ... }

        sub already_expired : Local Expires('-1d') { ... }

DESCRIPTION
    Provides a ActionRole to set HTTP Expires header for actions, which will
    be set unless Expires header was already set.

    Argument syntax matches the "-expires" from
    "CREATING_A_STANDARD_HTTP_HEADER:" in CGI.

SEE ALSO

    action not cachable by default.
